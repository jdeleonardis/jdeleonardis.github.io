                <p>Hello!  My name is Jay DeLeonardis and I am a web developer from Hillsborough, North Carolina.  I have spent nearly 25 years as a software developer, 
                    but have recently reimagined my career by enrolling in a Full Stack Developer program at the University of North Carolina.
                    This program is an intensive class covering
                    all aspects of web development including HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js (which this portfolio is written in), JQuery, AJAX, Express, Node, MongoDB, as well as using
                    GitHub for project repositories and source control.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated from the University of South Carolina in 1996 with a double major in Manangement Information Systems and Management. While enrolled
                    in college, I worked full time as an operations analyst in a data security department at South Carolina Electric and Gas.  Shortly after graduation,
                    I moved to Dallas, Texas and began my career as a contract programmer for Software Architects.  In 1999, my family and I moved to North Carolina, and 
                    I have spent the remainder of my career in the health care industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am fluent in several object oriented programming languages.  I spent many years as a Powerbuilder developer at an Identity laboratory
                    at Laboratory Corporation of America.  While at Labcorp, I was responsible for converting several applications to C#. I have also worked on many different databases,
                    including SQL Server, Oracle, and MS Access.
                </p>        
                <p>
                    As a previous member of many programming teams, I am very proud of my ability to work in a small group of developers, software testers, and especially end users.
                    I am always ready to lend a helping hand to less experienced programmers, and I feel that I make a very good teammate.  I am a strong listener, and I am always very 
                    cognizant of needs, problems, and challenges that end users may face.  I also spent a short time as an IT Director,
                    and while my experience in management wasn't exactly what I expected, I learned a lot about people's behavior which can help me in the future.
                </p>        
                <p>
                    I am looking forward to continuing my career at a company where I can become a member of a team, contribute technically, and provide leadership from my years of experience
                    in the IT industry..
                </p>
