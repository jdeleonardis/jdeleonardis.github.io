# My portfolio
This repo and deployed website is my portfolio.

# Description
This site was originally created as a homework assignment for the Full Stack Bootcamp.  However, as my skills in HTML, CSS, JS, etc have grown, the site has been updated with new techniques, as well as a true portfolio of my work.
