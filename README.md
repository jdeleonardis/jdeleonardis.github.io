Homework 2

# Description
This is my submitted work for Homework 2 - Responsive Portfolio.  The assignment was to create a portfolio that contained three html files - index.html, contact.html, and portfolio.html.  The html files needed to look like examples included in gitlab.

The site needs to contain the following items
* A navbar
* A responsive layot
* Responsive images

As a bonus, we could include a sticky footer and sub rows and sub columns (which are included in this site).

# Validation
All three HTML files were validated using https://validator.w3.org/.
